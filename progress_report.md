## Data 

To proceed with the term project, the dataset was chosen and integrated into [JNB](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents/Data_Science/Kazakh-Russian-Code-Switching-Analysis/Kaz-Rus-code-switching-dataset.ipynb#References:). The first dataset samples were elicited from the target IARPA Babel Kazakh Language Pack. For now, the first data sample consists of 400 text files and metadata  for further EDA. To analyze code-switching instances, the first draft of annotation scheme was developed based on [Dyachkov et al.(2020)](https://www.dialog-21.ru/media/5085/dyachkovvvplusetal-101.pdf) project who annotated and analyzed code-switching in four corpora of minority languages of Russia. The first attempt was made to annotate one text file on [LightTag](https://www.lighttag.io/). However, there are some technical nuances that will be discussed with course instructors in order to ensure the annotation quality. 

## Data Sharing

I got access to the above-mentioned dataset as a Pitt student through the university's LDC account. I am allowed to use this source only for Pitt affiliated projects and coursework. Therefore, I will only share data samples (max 5) to show what was accomplished. Also, if the annotation section of the project works as planned, I would share only excerpts and include observations on Analysis/Summary sections.



## Preliminary Report

- Project plan written;

- The project repo created on GitHub;

- Two possible datasets (KSC, Babel) were analyzed and one chosen based on rich dataset characteristics;

- The first 3 txt files were screened and 10 examples of code-switching were extracted. Examples: Russian words and phrases or Russian stem+Kazakh affixes;
 
- Initial LitReview results related to annotation types and structure:

-[1] Ide, & Pustejovsky, J. (2017). Handbook of Linguistic Annotation (Ide & J. Pustejovsky, Eds.;   1st ed. 2017.). Springer Netherlands. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-024-0881-2

- main stages of linguistic annotation;

- [MATTER cycle of linguistic annotation];

- annotation types, structures, and specifics;

-[2] Peirce, Gina (2016) Annotated sample of timed and untimed essays by heritage and second language learners from the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing (RULEC). [Dataset]

- The author used oXygen XML Editor software and annotated all inflectional morphology errors 	on nouns, adjectives and determiners in the sample texts from RULEC; 

- Dataset of the article includes an annotation scheme;
