### Project Plan

#### Kazakh-Russian Code-Switching Analysis 

##### Summary 

- This term project aims to carry out explanatory and linguistic analyses of Kazakh-Russian code-switching based on the conversational dataset. Kazakh-Russian code-switching is extremely common in daily communication since the majority of Kazakhs are bilingual. Inter-sentential and intra-sentential types of code-switching are practiced, however, intra-word code-switching is also observed. 

##### Data

- This project uses the IARPA Babel Program Kazakh language collection release IARPA-babel302b-v1.0a. 


##### Analysis

- The primary goal is to count the frequency of code-switching within conversation and analyze its morphological features through linguistic annotation. The project plan is as follows:

	- Screening the dataset for occurrence of Kazakh-Russian code switching: create general 	characteristics of code-switching examples (inter-sentential,intra-sentential, and intra-	word); 
	
	- Literature Review on syntactic and morphological annotation types and structure, review of 	research related to computational approach to code-switching;

	- Creating an annotation scheme that can capture Kazakh and Russian morphology (+syntax?);

	- Choosing an appropriate annotation structure from the following options: 
		1.Inline annotation of Plain Text; 
		2.Inline XML;
		3.Column-based annotations (offline);
		4.Standoff and Hybrid Standoff Annotations (offline);
	
	- Choosing annotation tools and annotating text files (50 conversations, tentative);

	- Analyzing annotated texts for frequency and types of code-switching, 	
	syntactic-morphological features of each occurrence, etc.

	- Sampling and building data frame from the Babel collection for explanatory purposes (age, 	gender, region of speakers, etc.);

	- Writing summary of analyses;

	- Identifying limitations;

	- Preparing a presentation based on the analysis.
