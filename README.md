### Kazakh-Russian-Code-Switching-Analysis

##### Moldir Baidildinova


- A brief summary: This term project aims to carry out explanatory and linguistic analyses of Kazakh-Russian code-switching based on the conversational dataset. Kazakh-Russian code-switching is extremely common in daily communication since the majority of Kazakhs are bilingual. Inter-sentential and intra-sentential types of code-switching are practiced, however, intra-word code-switching is also observed. The primary goal is to count the frequency of code-switching within conversation and analyze its morphological features through annotation.
